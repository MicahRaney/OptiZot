OptiZot is a platform meant to intelligently plan courses for University of California, Irvine. Tired of taking hours to find that perfect schedule? OptiZot will (hopefully) intelligently match you with the ideal course schedule optimized for time, day, professor, and other customizable preferences. You too can Zot faster and easier!

## Does it work?

Not yet.


## How do I start it?
(Copied from antplanner2's up and running instructions)

These instructions are going to be a bit esoteric for now. Bear with me until things are sorted out.

1. Download and install the [Google AppEngine Python SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads)
2. git clone https://github.com/gumho/antplanner2
3. cd antplanner2
4. dev_appserver.py .
